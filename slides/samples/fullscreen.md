Fullscreen slides with Reveal.js
================================

Created by [Asvin Goel](http://www.telematique.eu)

---

Reveal.js is great in showing slides in the same way on different screens with different sizes and aspect ratios.

--

However, by default not all of the screen can be used for presentation.

--

Sometimes you want to use all of the screen and this plugin allows you to.

--

Just include the `data-fullscreen` attribute to the section tag and the slide will use the entire screen.

---

How about showing your next holiday location?

---

<!-- .slide: data-fullscreen-->


<iframe class="stretch" data-src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m12!1m3!1d61206.89156051744!2d-151.77366863890407!3d-16.50433878928727!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sde!4v1467468929561"></iframe>

Or presenting some Google Spreadsheet?

--

<!-- .slide: data-fullscreen-->

<iframe class="stretch" data-src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HH4c7Wdcd6RBIbaw7WsTI4iYjgJAhCAul2td93I-coA/edit?usp=sharing"></iframe>

---

<!-- .slide: data-fullscreen-->

<iframe class="stretch" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kurZDZ5jT2Y" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Note that the fullscreen slides may look different on different screens.

--

It is advisable to only use the fullscreen mode for responsive content.
